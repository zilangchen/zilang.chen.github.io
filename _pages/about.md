I'm a third-year undergraduate student from the [ShienMing Wu School of Intelligent Engineering](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/wusie/) at [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/). My research interests include machine learning, robotics, embedded systems, and computational intelligence.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Gang Chen] at the ShienMing Wu School of Intelligent Engineering, SCUT, where I work on developing real-time robotic arm motion control algorithms using temporal logic. I was previously advised by [Prof. Yingjie Zhang] for designing and fabricating a remote-controlled multifunctional ball-picking robot and by [Prof. Zhicong Huang] for creating an embedded smart home terminal with lightweight machine learning.

You can find my CV here: [Chen Zilang's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
